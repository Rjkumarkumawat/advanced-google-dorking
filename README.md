## üìú Introduction  
Hello fellow hackers! I'm **Rajkumar Kumawat**, and today we're diving deep into **Google Dorking** ‚Äî the art of using Google's search operators to uncover hidden vulnerabilities and sensitive information.

## üß† Why Google Dorking Matters  
Google Dorking helps you:  
- Find exposed sensitive files (databases, passwords)  
- Discover hidden admin panels  
- Identify outdated software with known vulnerabilities  
- Gather intelligence for penetration testing

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Techniques (With Examples)  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Finding Exposed Documents  
```google
site:example.com ext:pdf OR ext:docx "confidential"
site:example.com intitle:"index of" "backup"
```
**Raj's Tip**: Try replacing `example.com` with your target domain. You might find juicy files!  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Discovering Login Portals  
```google
site:example.com intitle:"login" OR "admin"
site:example.com inurl:/wp-admin
```
**Found something?** Check for default credentials!  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ GitHub Secrets Hunting  
```google
site:github.com "example.com" AND ("api_key" OR "password")
```
**Raj's Experience**: I once found AWS keys exposed in a public GitHub repo!  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Network Device Discovery  
```google
intitle:"RouterOS" "Winbox"
inurl:/webui/login.jsp
```
These can reveal unprotected network devices.

## üî• Pro-Level Dork Combos  
Here are some of my favorite advanced queries:  

| Purpose | Dork Query |
|---------|-----------|
| Find PHP errors | `site:example.com "PHP Error" intext:"line"` |
| Open cameras | `intitle:"webcamXP 5"` |
| Exposed DBs | `filetype:sql "INSERT INTO"` |

## üõ°Ô∏è Defense Strategies  
As a security professional, I recommend:  
1. **Regularly Google yourself**: `site:yourdomain.com`  
2. **Use robots.txt** to block sensitive paths  
3. **Monitor GitHub** for accidental leaks
